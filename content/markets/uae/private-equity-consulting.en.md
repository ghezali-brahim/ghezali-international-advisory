<h2>Introduction: Private Equity in the UAE</h2>
<p>The UAE has developed a growing private equity ecosystem. Dubai and Abu Dhabi attract regional and international funds. Operational value creation has become a key differentiator. Ghezali International Advisory partners with PE funds to deliver private equity value creation consulting at the portfolio level. We work as an extension of the investment team, providing board-level support on strategy, M&amp;A, and operational improvement.</p>
<p>Our approach is tailored to the UAE and broader GCC context. We understand local partnership structures, regulatory evolution, and competitive landscapes. We focus on the levers that drive sustainable EBITDA growth and multiple expansion. Our portfolio company growth strategy work has supported companies across the region. We work with both regional funds and international investors with UAE exposure.</p>
<p>The UAE mid-market offers opportunities in sectors aligned with national diversification: healthcare, technology, logistics, education, and business services. Buy-and-build strategies are emerging. Challenges include talent retention, regulatory complexity, and geopolitical considerations. Our buy and build strategy consulting integrates these factors into value creation plans.</p>

<h2>Regulatory and Governance Context</h2>
<p>UAE private equity operates within an evolving regulatory framework. Free zones, mainland structures, and sector-specific rules apply. Governance expectations are rising. Our private equity operational improvement work integrates governance and reporting from day one, facilitating exits and LP alignment.</p>

<h2>Our Advisory Approach</h2>
<p>We provide private equity value creation consulting as a strategic partner. We work directly with GPs, portfolio company management, and boards. Our post acquisition growth strategy methodology focuses on commercial excellence, operational efficiency, and strategic optionality. We bring cross-border experience and local market understanding.</p>

<h2>Case Studies and Track Record</h2>
<p>Our track record includes over 500M€ in value created. We have supported funds in the UAE and broader GCC across multiple sectors. References are available for qualified counterparties.</p>
