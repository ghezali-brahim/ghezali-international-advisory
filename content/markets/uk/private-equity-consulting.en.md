<h2>Introduction: Private Equity in the United Kingdom</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom hosts one of the most developed private equity ecosystems in the world. London serves as a hub for fund formation, deal origination, and portfolio company management. For general partners seeking to maximise returns, private equity operational consulting has become a critical differentiator. Operational value creation, rather than financial engineering alone, drives the majority of returns in today's market.</p>
<p>Ghezali International Advisory partners with PE funds to deliver private equity value creation consulting at the portfolio level. We work as an extension of the investment team, providing board-level support on strategy, M&amp;A, and operational improvement. Our approach is tailored to the UK market: we understand local labour dynamics, regulatory constraints, and competitive landscapes. We focus on the levers that drive sustainable EBITDA growth and multiple expansion at exit.</p>
<p>Our engagements typically span the full investment lifecycle: from commercial due diligence and deal structuring, through post-acquisition value creation planning, to exit preparation. We bring a cross-border perspective that supports both UK-focused funds and international investors with UK exposure. Our portfolio company growth strategy work has supported over 200 mid-market companies across 25 countries.</p>

<h2>The UK PE Landscape: Opportunities and Constraints</h2>
<p>The UK mid-market offers abundant opportunities for private equity. Fragmentation, succession-driven exits, and operational underperformance create a steady flow of deal flow. Sectors such as business services, healthcare, technology, and industrials have attracted significant capital. Buy-and-build strategies have proven particularly effective in the UK, where add-on acquisitions can be integrated with relative ease compared to cross-border deals.</p>
<p>At the same time, the UK market presents distinct constraints. Labour shortages have increased wage pressure and made talent retention a priority. Brexit has added complexity to supply chains and regulatory compliance. Inflation and interest rate volatility have heightened the focus on operational improvement and cost discipline. Private equity operational consulting must account for these factors when designing value creation plans.</p>
<p>Fundraising conditions have tightened, and LPs are scrutinising operational capability more closely. GPs that can demonstrate a robust value creation playbook and track record of post-acquisition improvement are better positioned to raise and deploy capital. Our buy and build strategy consulting helps funds articulate and execute that playbook.</p>

<h2>Regulatory and Governance Context</h2>
<p>UK private equity operates within a well-defined regulatory framework. The FCA regulates fund managers, and the Takeover Panel oversees public company acquisitions. For mid-market private transactions, key considerations include competition (CMA), national security (NSI Act), and employment (TUPE). Understanding these frameworks is essential for efficient execution.</p>
<p>Governance expectations have risen. Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) guidelines and ESG considerations are influencing fund terms and portfolio company practices. Our private equity operational improvement work integrates governance and reporting from day one, ensuring alignment with LP expectations and facilitating future exits.</p>
<p>Tax structuring remains important. The UK has specific rules for carried interest, management fees, and deal structures. Working with experienced tax advisers, we help funds optimise structures while maintaining operational flexibility. Cross-border structures for international investors require careful coordination with local counsel.</p>

<h2>Our Advisory Approach: Value Creation at Board Level</h2>
<p>Ghezali International Advisory provides private equity value creation consulting as a strategic partner to the investment team. We do not operate as a traditional consulting firm with large engagement teams. Instead, we work directly with GPs, portfolio company management, and boards to design and implement value creation initiatives. Our involvement is typically at the board or executive committee level, with clear accountability for outcomes.</p>
<p>Our post acquisition growth strategy methodology focuses on three pillars: commercial excellence, operational efficiency, and strategic optionality. We help portfolio companies improve revenue growth through pricing, channel expansion, and commercial process. We support cost reduction through procurement, footprint optimisation, and process improvement. We identify and execute add-on acquisitions that strengthen the platform and accelerate growth.</p>
<p>We bring a hands-on, execution-oriented mindset. Our team includes former operators and executives who understand what it takes to implement change in mid-market companies. We work alongside management rather than in parallel, ensuring that initiatives are owned internally and sustained after our engagement ends.</p>
<p>Our fee structures align with fund economics. We offer retainer-based engagements, success fees linked to value creation or exit outcomes, and hybrid models. We are selective about mandates to ensure we can deliver the intensity of support that complex situations require.</p>

<h2>Case Studies and Track Record</h2>
<p>Our track record includes over 500M€ in value created across 200+ companies. In the UK, we have supported funds in sectors including industrial services, healthcare, business services, and technology. Representative engagements include: a buy-and-build in the UK facilities management sector, with four add-ons integrated over 18 months; operational turnaround of a struggling portfolio company prior to successful sale; and commercial due diligence and growth strategy for a platform acquisition in professional services.</p>
<p>In each case, our private equity operational consulting delivered measurable results: revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple improvement. We maintain strict confidentiality regarding client identities. References are available for qualified counterparties.</p>
