<h2>Introduction: Private Equity in the United States</h2>
<p>The United States hosts the world's largest private equity market. Operational value creation has become the primary driver of returns. Ghezali International Advisory partners with PE funds to deliver private equity value creation consulting at the portfolio level. We work as an extension of the investment team, providing board-level support on strategy, M&amp;A, and operational improvement.</p>
<p>Our approach is tailored to the US market. We understand local labour dynamics, regulatory constraints, and competitive landscapes. We focus on the levers that drive sustainable EBITDA growth and multiple expansion at exit. Our portfolio company growth strategy work has supported over 200 mid-market companies across 25 countries, including significant US exposure.</p>
<p>The US mid-market offers abundant opportunities. Fragmentation, succession-driven exits, and operational underperformance create deal flow. Buy-and-build strategies have proven effective. Challenges include labour shortages, inflation, and regulatory complexity. Our buy and build strategy consulting integrates these factors into value creation plans.</p>

<h2>Regulatory and Governance Context</h2>
<p>US private equity operates within federal and state frameworks. SEC regulation, antitrust (FTC, DOJ), and CFIUS for foreign investment apply where relevant. Sector-specific regulators add complexity. Governance expectations have risen. Our private equity operational improvement work integrates governance and reporting from day one.</p>

<h2>Our Advisory Approach</h2>
<p>We provide private equity value creation consulting as a strategic partner. We work directly with GPs, portfolio company management, and boards. Our post acquisition growth strategy methodology focuses on commercial excellence, operational efficiency, and strategic optionality. We bring a hands-on, execution-oriented mindset. Fee structures align with fund economics.</p>

<h2>Case Studies and Track Record</h2>
<p>Our track record includes over 500M€ in value created. In the US, we have supported funds across industrials, healthcare, business services, and technology. References are available for qualified counterparties.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>If you are a GP seeking private equity value creation consulting for US portfolio companies, contact us. Ghezali International Advisory operates from Paris, London, and New York. We respond within 24 hours.</p>
