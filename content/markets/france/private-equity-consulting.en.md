<h2>Introduction: Private Equity in France</h2>
<p>France hosts one of the most mature private equity ecosystems in Europe. Paris attracts funds, operators, and portfolio companies. For general partners seeking to maximise returns, private equity operational consulting has become a critical differentiator. Operational value creation, rather than leverage alone, drives the majority of performance. Ghezali International Advisory partners with PE funds in France to deliver private equity value creation consulting at the portfolio level.</p>
<p>We work as an extension of the investment team, providing board-level support on strategy, M&amp;A, and operational improvement. Our approach is tailored to the French market: we understand local labour dynamics, regulatory constraints, and competitive landscapes. We focus on the levers that drive sustainable EBITDA growth and multiple expansion at exit.</p>
<p>The French market offers numerous opportunities. Fragmentation, succession-driven exits, and operational underperformance fuel deal flow. Sectors such as business services, healthcare, technology, and industry attract significant capital. Buy-and-build strategies have proven effective. At the same time, constraints are real: talent shortages, regulatory complexity, structural costs. Our buy and build strategy consulting integrates these factors into value creation plan design.</p>

<h2>Regulatory and Governance Context</h2>
<p>French private equity operates within a defined regulatory framework. The AMF (Autorité des marchés financiers) supervises market participants. The Autorité de la concurrence and the foreign investment control mechanism (ICE) oversee acquisitions. Sector-specific rules (ACPR, HAS, etc.) apply where relevant. Understanding these frameworks is essential for smooth execution.</p>
<p>Governance expectations have increased. ESG and reporting practices influence fund terms and portfolio company practices. Our post-acquisition operational improvement work integrates governance from day one, ensuring alignment with LP expectations and facilitating future exits.</p>
<p>Tax structuring remains important. France has specific rules on capital taxation, notional interest, and deal structures. In coordination with tax advisers, we help funds optimise structures while maintaining operational flexibility.</p>

<h2>Our Advisory Approach: Value Creation at Board Level</h2>
<p>Ghezali International Advisory provides private equity value creation consulting as a strategic partner to the investment team. We do not operate as a traditional consulting firm with large teams. We work directly with GPs, portfolio company management, and boards to design and implement value creation initiatives. Our involvement is typically at board or executive committee level, with clear accountability for results.</p>
<p>Our post acquisition growth strategy methodology rests on three pillars: commercial excellence, operational efficiency, and strategic optionality. We help portfolio companies improve revenue growth through pricing, channel expansion, and commercial processes. We support cost reduction through procurement, footprint optimisation, and process improvement. We identify and execute add-ons that strengthen the platform and accelerate growth.</p>
<p>Our track record includes over 500M€ in value created across 200+ companies. In France, we have supported funds in industrial services, healthcare, business services, and technology. Representative mandates include: buy-and-build in facilities services with several integrated add-ons; operational turnaround of a portfolio company prior to successful sale; commercial due diligence and growth strategy for a platform acquisition.
